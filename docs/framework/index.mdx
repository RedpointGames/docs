To help you integrate Epic Online Services into your game, the Redpoint EOS Online Framework provides many pre-built components, actors, UMG widgets and blueprint nodes that focus on solving the most common scenarios.

If you find that the pre-built components don't quite fit your project, you can always use the [online subsystem blueprint nodes](/ossv1/index.mdx) or [modern C++ APIs](/systems/index.md).

:::warning
This documentation assumes that you've run through the [Getting started](/setup/index.mdx) guide first.
