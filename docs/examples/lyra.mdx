description: Use our modified version of Lyra that is tailored for Epic Online Services.

import Button from "@site/src/Button";

We offer a modified version of the Lyra example project that Epic Games provides, configured to use Redpoint's EOS Online Framework instead. Unlike the default Lyra example, you don't need to build Unreal Engine from source in order to enable EOS.

:::warning
We don't recommend Lyra to new developers. It requires knowledge of C++, and does not demonstrate Redpoint EOS Online Framework features that make implementing multiplayer games easier, including team matchmaking.

For an example project tailored to Epic Online Services, we recommend starting with [Minute of Mayhem](./minute/index.mdx) instead.

### Accessing the Lyra example project

To access the Lyra example project, make sure you have uploaded your receipt for EOS Online Framework to the [License Manager](https://licensing.redpoint.games/account). You'll then be able to [access the Lyra example on GitLab](https://src.redpoint.games/redpointgames/lyra).

:::info
Due to the way the Lyra example is currently licensed by Epic Games, we can't have the Lyra repository public on GitLab. The only way for us to verify that you've agreed to the Unreal Engine EULA is to have you upload your receipt for EOS Online Framework.

This unfortunately means we can't currently make the modified Lyra example available to Free Edition users.

If we get permission from Epic Games in the future to make the modified Lyra example project public on GitLab, we'll do so.

### Building the Lyra example project

You can build the project either by generating the solution files (right-click on the `Lyra.uproject` -> "Generate solution files") and building in Visual Studio, or you can build from the command line using [UET, the Unreal Engine Tool](https://docs.redpoint.games/uet/):

```powershell
uet build -d Lyra -e 5.6
```
