import bpAccess from "./access.bp";

This API reference provides auto-generated documentation for all of the supported blueprint functions and events. It also indicates what functionality is not currently available.

:::warning
This reference includes all blueprint nodes auto-generated from the engine source code. Some functions and events are not supported by Epic Online Services, and can only be used with a local platform subsystem that implements them.
:::

:::info
The Free Edition only allows using blueprint nodes to interact with Epic Online Services; calls to "Get Named Subsystem" will fail with an error. If you need to access platform-specific online functionality in blueprints, you'll need to upgrade to the Paid Edition.
:::

## Accessing a subsystem

To access the subsystem for Epic Online Services, you can just use (for example) the "Online Achievements Subsystem" blueprint node.

If you need to access a platform-specific subsystem for achievements, you could use the "Get Named Achievements Subsystem" blueprint node off the "Online Subsystem" node.

<Blueprint height="300px" blueprint={bpAccess} />
