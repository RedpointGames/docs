Lobbies are like sessions, except that lobby data, lobby member data and the member list is automatically kept in-sync for all of the clients who are in the lobby. Sessions don't automatically synchronise player lists from the host of the match to clients.

Lobbies can't be used by dedicated servers.

Lobbies and parties both use "EOS Lobbies" under the hood, which is why you can [join a party from a lobby search result](ossv1/lobbies/joining.mdx#joining-a-lobby-as-party).

## Prerequisites

If you're using C++, you'll need to add the [Online Interfaces headers](https://src.redpoint.games/redpointgames/online-interfaces/) to your project so you can access the lobby APIs.

If you're using Online Subsystem Blueprints, you don't need to do any additional steps to access the lobby APIs.

## Create a lobby

<Tabs lazy groupId="code-format" defaultValue="c++" values={[ { label: 'C++', value: 'c++' }, { label: 'Blueprints', value: 'blueprints' } ]}>
<TabItem value="c++">

To create a lobby, first get the online lobby interface:

```cpp
#include "OnlineSubsystem.h"
#include "OnlineSubsystemUtils.h"
// If your project can't find this header, make sure you have installed the headers from here:
// https://src.redpoint.games/redpointgames/online-interfaces/
#include "OnlineLobbyInterface.h"

// ...

IOnlineSubsystem* Subsystem = Online::GetSubsystem(this->GetWorld());
TSharedPtr<IOnlineLobby, ESPMode::ThreadSafe> Lobby = Online::GetLobbyInterface(Subsystem);
```

Then, make a lobby transaction for creating the lobby:

```cpp
TSharedPtr<const FUniqueNetId> LocalUserId = Identity->GetUniquePlayerId(0);
TSharedPtr<FOnlineLobbyTransaction> Txn = Lobby->MakeCreateLobbyTransaction(*LocalUserId.Get());

// To enable voice chat on a lobby, set the special "EOSVoiceChat_Enabled" metadata value.
Txn->SetMetadata.Add(TEXT("EOSVoiceChat_Enabled"), true);

// To allow clients connecting to the listen server to join the lobby based on just the ID, we need
// to set it to public.
Txn->Public = true;

// Here you can adjust the capacity of the lobby. 
Txn->Capacity = 4;

// Setting a lobby as locked prevents players from joining it.
Txn->Locked = false;
```

Then, create the lobby:

```cpp
if (!Lobby->CreateLobby(
    *LocalUserId.Get(),
    *Txn,
    FOnLobbyCreateOrConnectComplete::CreateLambda([](
        const FOnlineError & Error,
        const FUniqueNetId & UserId,
        const TSharedPtr<class FOnlineLobby> & CreatedLobby)
    {
        if (Error.WasSuccessful())
        {
            // The lobby was created successfully and is now in CreatedLobby.
            FString IdStr = CreatedLobby->Id->ToString();

            // You'll need to store IdStr somewhere, as that is what needs to be sent to connecting clients.
        }
        else
        {
            // Lobby could not be created.
        }
    })))
{
    // Call failed to start.
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="blueprints">

When the "Create Lobby" operation finishes, make sure you store the returned "Lobby" object somewhere. You'll need to send the lobby's ID to connecting clients later.

<Blueprint height="500px" blueprint={bpCreate} />

You can customize the created lobby by calling the following blueprint nodes off the "Create Lobby Transaction" before you pass it to "Create Lobby":

- "Set Metadata"
- "Set Metadata by Map"
- "Set Locked"
- "Set Capacity"
- "Set Public"

There are also "Delete Metadata" and "Delete Metadata by Array" blueprint nodes, but these only have an effect when [updating an existing lobby](ossv1/lobbies/data.mdx).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
