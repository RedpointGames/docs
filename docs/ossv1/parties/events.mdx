title: Responding to events
description: A list of party events that are supported in EOS Online Framework.
---

You can respond to changes in the party using the events on `IOnlinePartySystem`. This document lists the events which are currently supported.

Events relating to party members, such as `OnPartyMemberJoined` and `OnMemberAttributeChanged` are raised for all members of the party, not just the local user.

## Party system events

The following documents the list of events and their implementation status:
