Epic Online Services does not yet have support for avatars; even Epic Games accounts don't have avatars on their profiles.

However, native platforms such as Steam have avatars. When you sign in with a native platform, you might be displaying accounts from platforms such as Steam, which *do* support avatars.

To allow you to display avatars for native platforms, EOS implements the [IOnlineAvatar](https://src.redpoint.games/redpointgames/online-interfaces/) interface.

To fetch an avatar, call:

```cpp
Online::GetAvatarInterface(OSS)->GetAvatar(
    LocalUserId,
    TargetUserId,
    DefaultAvatar,
    FOnGetAvatarComplete::CreateLambda([](bool bWasSuccessful, TSoftObjectPtr<UTexture> ResultTexture) {

    }));
```

This API call is also available via Online Subsystem Blueprints.

You should cache the result of this call, as the avatar will be downloaded/fetched each time `GetAvatar` is called.

Avatars are currently supported on the following platforms:

- Steam
- Discord
- Oculus
- itch.io
