It is important to understand the lifecycle of sessions, so you know when to use different session related calls. Note that the recommended flow has you start a listen or dedicated server *before* creating a session.

## Session lifecycle on host

The diagram below shows the lifecycle of a session from the host's perspective.

    Begin --> |"Start a listen or dedicated server"|GameListening
    GameListening[Game is now listening on a port] --> |"Call CreateSession"|SessionCreated
    SessionCreated[Game is now hosting a session] --> |"A player connects to the<br/>server e.g. OnPostLogin"|PlayerConnects
    PlayerConnects[Game has a new player] --> |"Call RegisterPlayer"|PlayerRegistered
    PlayerRegistered[Player has been registered] --> WaitingForPlayers
    SessionCreated --> |"A player disconnects from the<br/>server e.g. OnLogout"|PlayerDisconnects
    PlayerDisconnects[Game has lost a player] --> |"Call UnregisterPlayer"|PlayerUnregistered
    PlayerUnregistered[Player has been unregistered] --> WaitingForPlayers
    WaitingForPlayers[Wait for players or start the session] --> |"Call StartSession"|SessionStarted
    WaitingForPlayers[Wait for players or start the session] --> |"Wait for more players"|SessionCreated
    SessionStarted[Session is now started, and no longer joinable unless JoinInProgress was set] --> |"Call EndSession"|SessionCreated
    SessionStarted --> |"Call DestroySession"|SessionDestroyed
    SessionDestroyed[Game no longer has a session] --> |"Stop the listen or dedicated server"|GameStandalone
    GameStandalone[Game has returned to e.g. the main menu]

## Session lifecycle on client

The diagram below shows the lifecycle of a session from the client's perspective.

<Mermaid chart={`
graph TD
    Begin --> |"Call FindSessions"|SearchResults
    SearchResults[At least one session found in search results] --> |"Call JoinSession"|SessionJoined
    SessionJoined[Game has joined session, but not server yet] --> |"Use GetResolvedConnectString and Browse to the server URL"|GameJoined
    GameJoined[Game is now connected to server] --> |"Browse to the main menu map or be kicked by the server"|GameLeft
    GameLeft[Game is no longer connected to server] --> |"Call DestroySession"|SessionDestroyed
    SessionDestroyed[Client can now join another session]
