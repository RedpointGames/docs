Turning on presence sessions allows players to join sessions from the Epic Games Overlay.

## Configuration

To enable **Join** and **Invite** functionality in the Epic Games Overlay for parties, make sure you set the `PresenceAdvertises` setting to `Session`, like so:

```ini
[EpicOnlineServices]
PresenceAdvertises=Session
```

## Handling events

To handle session invites being accepted in the overlay (when you click **Accept** on a session invite) and to handle session joins in the overlay (when you click **Join** on a friend's session), your game needs to listen for the `OnSessionUserInviteAccepted` event on the session interface.

The delegate handler for this event **must call JoinSession** (and once that succeeds, perform the `open` call to actually connect the client to the server).

### Specifying the presence session

Only one session can be set as the "presence session" (that is, the one associated with the overlay). This is determined by setting `bUsesPresence` when the session is created, and this setting is inherited on all clients that join the session.
