When you run dedicated game servers on PlayFab, there's additional set up that needs to be performed so that they can communicate with the EOS backend.

:::danger
We strongly advise against using PlayFab for hosting dedicated game servers, as you'll see costs **6-12x higher** than if you deployed your game servers from a local provider. Read [Avoiding public clouds](/dedis/avoiding_public_clouds.mdx) for more information.

## Additional set up instructions for PlayFab

The PlayFab execution environment lacks the latest Amazon root certificates, which are necessary for the EOS SDK to communicate with the Epic Online Services backend.

First you'll need to download the certificates from [Amazon Trust Services](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/):

- [AmazonRootCA1.cer](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.cer)
- [AmazonRootCA2.cer](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA2.cer)
- [AmazonRootCA3.cer](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA3.cer)
- [AmazonRootCA4.cer](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA4.cer)
- [SFSRootCAG2.cer](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/SFSRootCAG2.cer)

Then create a wrapper script called `startup.cmd` to launch your game server, with the following contents:

```
certutil.exe -addstore root .\AmazonRootCA1.cer
certutil.exe -addstore root .\AmazonRootCA2.cer
certutil.exe -addstore root .\AmazonRootCA3.cer
certutil.exe -addstore root .\AmazonRootCA4.cer
certutil.exe -addstore root .\SFSRootCAG2.cer
.\MyGameServer.exe -log
```
