Redpoint EOS Online Framework integrates the Discord Social SDK so that players can join parties and multiplayer sessions over Discord.

:::warning
Due to license restrictions that prevent us from redistributing the Discord Social SDK, Discord integration is not available in the Free Edition.
:::

## Switch to using source code

If you have not done so already, [switch to using a source-based version](../../support/clone_from_gitlab.mdx) of the plugin.

## Download and install the Discord Social SDK

To use Discord integration, you need to download the Discord Social SDK from their developer portal:

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create an application for your game if you have not done so already.
3. Under **Discord Social SDK** in the sidebar, click **Downloads**.
4. Select version `1.3.9273` for `PC & Essentials`.
5. Download the C++ ZIP. Do not download the Unreal Engine plugin.
6. Extract the Discord Social SDK into `(Project Directory)\Plugins\DiscordSocialSdk-1.3.9273`.

After you have extracted the Discord Social SDK, `(Project Directory)\Plugins\DiscordSocialSdk-1.3.9273\discord_social_sdk\License-Notices.txt` should exist.

## Enable Discord integration in your game

Discord integration is not built by default, so you need to explicitly turn it on for your project's build. In each `.Target.cs` file (the main one and the `Editor` variant), you need to add this project definition:

```csharp
ProjectDefinitions.Add("ONLINE_SUBSYSTEM_EOS_ENABLE_DISCORD=1");
```

## Configure the Discord online subsystem in your game

In your `DefaultEngine.ini` file (or `WindowsEngine.ini` if you want to configure it for a specific platform), you need to add the following settings:

```ini
[Redpoint.Discord]
ApplicationId=YOUR_DISCORD_APP_ID
```

If your game is also launching on Steam, you can tell Discord how to launch your game on Steam when a user wants to join a multiplayer game or party:

```ini
[Redpoint.Discord]
SteamApplicationId=YOUR_STEAM_APP_ID
```
