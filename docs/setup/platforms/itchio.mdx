description: How to set up your game for itch.io.
---

To publish your game on itch.io, you just need to configure itch.io in the Epic Games Developer portal.

## Add the required scope to your itch.io game

To authenticate with itch.io, you have to tell the itch.io app to provide the JWT as an environment variable at runtime.

You need to add the following to your `.itch.toml` file, located in the root of the packaged build that you upload. If you don't have an `.itch.toml` file, create one:

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "play"
path = "YourGame.exe"
scope = "profile:me"
```

If you don't set up `.itch.toml` correctly, or if you launch your game outside of the itch.io app, you'll see the following error in the logs:

```
LogRedpointItchIo: Error: Can't sign in with itch.io, ITCHIO_API_KEY environment variable is missing.
```

## Set up itch.io authentication in the Epic Games Dev Portal

1. Open the [Epic Games Dev Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/).
2. Navigate to your product.
3. Click "Product Settings".
4. Under the "Identity Providers" tab, click "Add Identity Provider".
5. Select "itch.io" as the identity provider.
6. Set the "Description" to any value you like.
7. Set the "Game ID" to the ID of your itch.io game. When you are editing the game on itch.io, it will be located in the URL like so: `https://itch.io/game/edit/<GAME_ID_HERE>`.
8. Click "Save & Exit".
9. Under the "Environments" tab, click "Identity Providers" next to the Live sandbox.
10. For itch.io, select the new credential you just made.

## Enable the itch.io online subsystem in your game

In your `DefaultEngine.ini` file (or `WindowsEngine.ini` if you want to configure it for a specific platform), you need to add the following settings:

```ini
[OnlineSubsystemRedpointItchIo]
bEnabled=True
```

## Enable itch.io avatars

itch.io avatars are supported automatically.

:::caution
Only the avatar for the locally signed in player can be fetched. Avatars for other itch.io players can not be retrieved, as itch.io does not provide an API for this.
:::

## Use itch.io authentication at runtime

The default authentication graph will automatically use itch.io authentication if your game is launched through the itch.io app.

## Testing itch.io authentication

To test itch.io authentication, you will need to launch your game through the itch.io app.
