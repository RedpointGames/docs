To publish your game on Apple iOS, you'll need to enable "Sign in with Apple" authentication, use a source-based version of the plugin and a source-based version of Unreal Engine, compile it with SIWA support, and then configure your application for Apple authentication.

## Switch to using source code

If you have not done so already, [switch to using a source-based version](../index.mdx#source-code-access) of the plugin by following the instructions on the Welcome page.

## Compile the engine with "Sign in with Apple" support

Unreal Engine does not enable "Sign in with Apple" support by default, and it must be enabled when the engine's `OnlineSubsystemApple` module is compiled. Therefore, you must build the engine from source after enabling this option.

Locate the `Engine/Config/BaseEngine.ini` file for the source-based version of Unreal Engine you are using, and at the end of this file, add:

```ini
[/Script/IOSRuntimeSettings.IOSRuntimeSettings]
bEnableSignInWithAppleSupport=True
```

## Set up your application in the Apple Developer portal

It is assumed that you already have an identifier set up for your application in the Apple Developer portal, as this is a prerequisite for iOS development.

1. Locate your App ID on the [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) page.
2. Note the "Identifier" for your App; you will need this for the Epic Games Developer portal in a moment.
3. Click on the App ID you want to set up.
4. Scroll down to "Sign In with Apple" and click the checkbox next to it.
5. Click "Save" in the top right.

## Set up Apple authentication in the Epic Games Dev Portal

1. Open the [Epic Games Dev Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/).
2. Navigate to your product.
3. Click "Product Settings".
4. Under the "Identity Providers" tab, click "Add Identity Provider".
5. Select "Apple" as the identity provider.
6. Set the "Description" to any value you like.
7. Set the "Client ID" to your iOS app identifier that you noted down from the previous steps.
8. Click "Save & Exit".
9. Under the "Environments" tab, click "Identity Providers" next to the Live sandbox.
10. For Apple, select the new credential you just made.

## Enable the Apple online subsystem in your game

In your `IOSEngine.ini` file, you need to add the following settings:

```ini
[OnlineSubsystemApple]
bEnabled=True
```

## Use Apple authentication at runtime

The default authentication graph will automatically use Apple authentication if the game is launched on iOS.

## Testing Apple authentication

To test Apple authentication, launch your game on an iOS device and sign in.
