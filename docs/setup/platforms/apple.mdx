To publish your game on Apple iOS, you'll need to enable "Sign in with Apple" authentication and then configure your application for Apple authentication.

## Set up your application in the Apple Developer portal

It is assumed that you already have an identifier set up for your application in the Apple Developer portal, as this is a prerequisite for iOS development.

1. Locate your App ID on the [Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) page.
2. Note the "Identifier" for your App; you will need this for the Epic Games Developer portal in a moment.
3. Click on the App ID you want to set up.
4. Scroll down to "Sign In with Apple" and click the checkbox next to it.
5. Click "Save" in the top right.

## Set up Apple authentication in the Epic Games Dev Portal

1. Open the [Epic Games Dev Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/).
2. Navigate to your product.
3. Click "Product Settings".
4. Under the "Identity Providers" tab, click "Add Identity Provider".
5. Select "Apple" as the identity provider.
6. Set the "Description" to any value you like.
7. Set the "Client ID" to your iOS app identifier that you noted down from the previous steps.
8. Click "Save & Exit".
9. Under the "Environments" tab, click "Identity Providers" next to the Live sandbox.
10. For Apple, select the new credential you just made.

## Enable Sign in with Apple in your project

In your `DefaultEngine.ini` file, add:

```ini
[/Script/IOSRuntimeSettings.IOSRuntimeSettings]
bEnableSignInWithAppleSupport=True
```

You no longer need to build the engine from source for "Sign in with Apple" support to work. You only need to add this setting so that the appropriate entitlement is added when your game is packaged.

## Enable voice chat support

If you plan on using voice chat in your game, you need to change the "Additional Plist Data" under "Project Settings -> iOS" to describe what the microphone will be used for.

In your `DefaultEngine.ini` file, add:

```ini
[/Script/IOSRuntimeSettings.IOSRuntimeSettings]
AdditionalPlistData=<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>\n<string>The microphone is used for in-game voice chat.</string>\n
```

:::warning
If you attempt to use voice chat on iOS without setting `AdditionalPlistData` to include the microphone usage description, the game will crash.
:::

## Use Apple authentication at runtime

The default authentication graph will automatically use Apple authentication if the game is launched on iOS.

## Testing Apple authentication

To test Apple authentication, launch your game on an iOS device and sign in.
