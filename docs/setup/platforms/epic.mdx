To enable Epic Games Store authentication, you need to be using Epic Games as the cross-platform account provider.

## Enable Epic Games as the cross-platform account provider

Ensure under Project Settings that your "Cross Platform Account Provider" is set to "EpicGames".

You can also set it in `DefaultEngine.ini` like so:

```ini
[EpicOnlineServices]
CrossPlatformAccountProvider=EpicGames
; You should also set this to true if you are only launching on EGS.
RequireCrossPlatformAccount=True
```

## Optionally turn on EGS launch requirement

If you want to require that your game is launched from the Epic Games Store, you can turn on "Require Epic Games Launcher" in Project Settings.

You can also set it in `DefaultEngine.ini` like so:

```ini
[EpicOnlineServices]
RequireEpicGamesLauncher=True
```

## Testing Epic Games Store authentication

When you are developing, you'll still see `scope_consent_required` and the web browser will still open to approve scopes.

The Epic Games Store only implicitly grants access to scopes when a user purchases or claims a game on the Epic Games Store. It does not implicitly grant permission when redeeming a key or logging in from outside the Epic Games Store.

It is normal and expected to see the web browser prompt for permissions during development and release, based on how users purchased your game.
