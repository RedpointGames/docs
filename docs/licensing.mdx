Before you use the EOS Online Framework plugin, you need to determine which license applies to you.

## Licensing guide

You can use the interactive licensing guide below to help you determine whether you need to purchase EOS Online Framework on Fab.

<LicensingGuide />

## Paid Edition terms

When you purchase the EOS Online Framework plugin on Fab, the Fab Terms of Service apply, and supersede any restrictions that are present in the free edition.

For your usage rights when you purchase the EOS Online Framework plugin, refer to the [Fab FAQ](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fab/licenses-and-pricing-in-fab).

## Free edition terms

Below is a human-readable summary of the free edition license, followed by the legal agreement you are bound by when you use the free edition.

### Summary

- **<u>Absolutely no support is included in the free edition.</u>** This means we can't help you diagnose issues, resolve bugs or implement features. This also means you can't access the support channel in the Discord.
- The free edition requires attribution. You must include somewhere in your product (such as a license file or credits screen) that you are using the EOS Online Framework plugin.
- The free edition does not include source code access. If you need access to the source code (whether to modify it or for debugging), you will need to purchase a license.
- If you are an individual, you can't be earning more than $30,000 USD annually. We consider your aggregate salary you currently earn (even if you only started earning that salary recently).
- If you are a company, the company must have an annual turnover less than $30,000 USD, and none of the companies employees or directors can be earning over $30,000 USD, whether that's a salary from the company or outside earnings.
- If you are a plugin developer, you can not include parts of the EOS Online Framework plugin in your own plugin without binding your own customers to the same terms outlined here. _This means that you can not distribute your plugin on Fab, as the Fab Usage Rights and the free edition license restrictions are incompatible._
- If your income circumstances change such that either you as an individual or as a company start earning above the threshold, you need to purchase a license to EOS Online Framework on Fab.
