Matchmaking provides a low-level C++ API that you can use to do team-based matchmaking. You can also [use blueprints if you prefer](../blueprints/index.mdx).

An overview of how C++ matchmaking works as follows:

- You'll get an instance of the matchmaking engine by calling `IMatchmakingEngine::Get()`.
- You'll create your request and optionally host configuration (for the party leader), and then enqueue your request into the matchmaking engine.
  - Your request configuration also includes references to the OnProgress and OnComplete events that you want to fire as matchmaking progresses.
- You'll need to track when players are ready in the party, and enqueue/cancel requests as needed. Unlike blueprint-based matchmaking, the C++ APIs do not track party status for you.
- The OnComplete callback for the matchmaking request will always fire, even after map loads.
- To access the team and slot information of players at runtime, you'll need to store the matchmaking results in your game somewhere and access them via your own storage. The <NodeRef name="Get Team and Slot for Player" /> blueprint nodes will not work, as these only work with the blueprint matchmaker.
- The C++ APIs support the full set of options, including experimental options that might change in the future.

If C++ matchmaking sounds ideal for your project, continue to [Queue into matchmaking](../cpp/queue_to_matchmaking.md).
