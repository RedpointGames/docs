import Blueprint from "@site/src/Blueprint";

import bpSubmit from "./bp/submit.bp";

If you're using skill-based matchmaking, your game server will need to submit match results once the game is complete.

You can do so by using the "Submit Match Results" blueprint node on the Matchmaker Subsystem, like so:

<Blueprint height="410px" blueprint={bpSubmit} />

In the example above, we are reporting the scores as follows:

- Team 0 scored 200 points.
- Team 1 scored 100 points.
- Team 2 scored 150 points.

The plugin will order the teams by their score, and then adjust each player's Openskill ranking based on whether they won or lost the match.
