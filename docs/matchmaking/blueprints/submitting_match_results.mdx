import Blueprint from "@site/src/Blueprint";

import bpSubmit from "./bp/submit.bp";

If you're using skill-based matchmaking, your game server will need to submit match results once the game is complete.

You can do so by using the <NodeRef name="Submit Match Results" /> blueprint node on the Matchmaker Subsystem, like so:

<Blueprint height="410px" blueprint={bpSubmit} />

In the example above, we are reporting the scores as follows:

- Team 0 scored 200 points.
- Team 1 scored 100 points.
- Team 2 scored 150 points.

The plugin will order the teams by their score, and then adjust each player's Openskill ranking based on whether they won or lost the match.
