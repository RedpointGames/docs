Matchmaking provides a high-level, blueprint-based way of doing matchmaking in Unreal Engine. You can also [use C++ if you prefer](../cpp/index.mdx).

An overview of how blueprint-based matchmaking works is as follows:

- You'll create a subclass of the `Matchmaker` actor, and configure your matchmaking as Class Settings or at runtime on "Begin Play".
- Unlike C++, the blueprint matchmaker automatically tracks which party members are ready, and automatically queues the party into matchmaking when every member is readied up.
- The matchmaker's events like <NodeRef name="On Progress" event /> will fire as matchmaking takes place.
- The matchmaker subsystem's events like <NodeRef name="On Complete" event /> will fire once the listen server has started or the client has joined the server.
- You can access the user's team and slot information by using the <NodeRef name="Get Team and Slot for Player" /> blueprint node off the matchmaker subsystem, and you can use this on both the server and clients.
- The blueprint-based matchmaker supports a smaller set of configuration options than the C++ APIs. This is because some of the C++ APIs are still experimental, and are not exposed to blueprints until they are stable.

If blueprint-based matchmaking sounds ideal for your project, continue to [Setting up the matchmaker](./matchmaker.mdx).
