To queue a player or a party up for matchmaking, you need to have each player indicate their readiness.

Once all players in a party are ready, or if you're not in a party and the only local player is ready, matchmaking will begin.

## Queuing solo, or parties with no split-screen

If you're queuing a solo player locally, or if you're in a party but don't support split-screen in your game, you can call "Set Ready State" with a default user ID in the `Matchmaker`. It'll automatically select the user ID of the first local player controller.

<Blueprint height="280px" blueprint={bpQueueSolo} />

## Queuing parties with split-screen

If you have multiple local players (such as on console), you'll need to tell the matchmaker which local player is readying up for matchmaking by passing their user ID.

<Blueprint height="280px" blueprint={bpQueueSplit} />

## Unreadying a player

To unready a previously readied player, just call `Set Ready State` again with the same arguments, but with "Is Ready" set to false.
