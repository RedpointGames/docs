title: Matchmaking step names and algorithm flow
description: An extensive document covering all the step names you can encounter during matchmaking and how the algorithm flows through steps.

import Mermaid from "@site/src/Mermaid";

This document describes all of the steps that the matchmaking algorithm can be in, and how it moves between each of these steps. The step names shown in each node will match the step name given to you by the progress event. The set of steps related to abandonment are shown in a separate graph since the matchmaking algorithm can enter the abandonment sequence at any time.

## Matchmaking

This is the algorithm used by the matchmaking plugin to match players. The primary mechanism by which matchmaking takes place is the searching and follow request concepts, where hosts search for suitable matches they'd like to have merged into their match. They then send the follow request to the target match, and the target either accepts (and merges) or rejects it.

Once the match is full, the matchmaking algorithm then also takes care of starting a listen server or finding a dedicated server, and then notifying the other players of the session ID or connection string depending on the matchmaking request configuration.

## Abandonment

Abandonment is used by the matchmaking algorithm when something goes wrong or one of the members of the match cancels matchmaking. When abandonment happens, all of the members that are currently in the match unwind their state to the way it was when they initially queued, and then they either restart matchmaking (if it was a temporary error or a cancellation by some other party), or they fire the `OnCancelled` event.
