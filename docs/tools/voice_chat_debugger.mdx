When you are testing your implementation of voice chat in the editor, it can be difficult to see what is happening for each play-in-editor window. To mitigate this, Redpoint EOS Online Framework provides the Voice Chat Debugger. This editor window show you the full state of voice chat including recent audio levels, and provides you with options to change or tweak the settings during gameplay:

<Video url={videoDebugger} />

To open the Voice Chat Debugger, select the **Tools menu** and then in the dropdown select **Voice Chat Debugger**. The debugger will not show anything until you start playing the game in the editor.
