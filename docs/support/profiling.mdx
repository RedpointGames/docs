title: Profiling with Unreal Insights
description: Profiling your network traffic with Unreal Insights.
---

The EOS Online Framework plugin adds custom performance counters and metrics to track how long EOS operations take on the main game thread, and how much network traffic (in terms of packets and bytes) are being sent over EOS P2P.

To view these metrics, launch Unreal Insights before starting your game.

When you launch your game, add these command line arguments: `-statnamedevents -trace=cpu,counters,eos,frame,bookmark,stats,net -messaging -nettrace=1 -tracehost=localhost`.

If you are launching your game on a mobile device or console, you will need to also provide the IP address of your local machine: `-statnamedevents -trace=cpu,counters,eos,frame,bookmark,stats,net -messaging -nettrace=1 -tracehost=<your PC IP address>`.
