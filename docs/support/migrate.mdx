title: Migrate to EOS Online Framework
description: Learn how to migrate your project from Online Subsystem Blueprints and Matchmaking plugins to the EOS Online Framework.
---

If you previously used the Online Subsystem Blueprints or Matchmaking plugins, and are now upgrading to the EOS Online Framework, you'll need to migrate your project.

## Upgrade your license

If you don't yet have access to EOS Online Framework in Fab or GitLab, use the [upgrade page in the License Manager](https://licensing.redpoint.games/upgrade) to switch your license over.

## Close the editor

Close the editor if it is already open.

## Backup your project!

Make a complete backup of your project before proceeding.

## Download the EOS Online Framework plugin

If you haven't already done so, [download the EOS Online Framework plugin via Fab or GitLab](../index.mdx#install-the-plugin).

## Add the EOS Online Framework plugin to your project

If you didn't have "EOS Online Subsystem" previously enabled in your project, you'll need to add the EOS Online Framework now. Open your `.uproject` file in a text editor, and add the following entry to the `Plugins` array in your `.uproject` file.

```json
{
  "Name": "OnlineSubsystemRedpointEOS",
  "Enabled": true,
  "MarketplaceURL": "com.epicgames.launcher://ue/marketplace/product/2c92594ce5aa416c8bfbd79275389e3b"
}
```

Please note that entries in the `Plugins` array need to be separated by commas (`,`). There must not be a comma between the last entry and the closing square bracket (`]`).

## Turn off the Online Subsystem Blueprints and Matchmaking plugins in your project

The functionality of the Online Subsystem Blueprints and Matchmaking plugins are now included in EOS Online Framework. Leaving them enabled will cause a conflict when you try to load your project, so turn them off now.

Open your `.uproject` in a text editor, and change `Enabled` to `false` for Online Subsystem Blueprints and Matchmaking:

```json
{
  "Name": "OnlineSubsystemBlueprints",
  "Enabled": false
},
{
  "Name": "Matchmaking",
  "Enabled": false
},
```

## Open your project

Save your changes to your `.uproject` file and open the project in the editor again. Everything should load correctly.
