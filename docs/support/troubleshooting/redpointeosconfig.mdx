title: "'RedpointEOSConfig' module could not be loaded"
description: Learn how to fix module load errors.
---

If you encounter the error message `failed to load because module 'RedpointEOSConfig' could not be found`, you'll need to build your project in Visual Studio. If you are using a blueprint-only project, you'll need to add a C++ file to your project first.

:::info
The `RedpointEOSConfig` and `RedpointEOSShared` modules are configured to load very early in the engine lifecycle. We have to do this to handle compatibility with Fab which uses Epic Online Services for authentication. Unfortunately, when modules are marked to load `EarliestPossible`, they attempt to load prior to the engine's out-of-date module check and this is why you get an error instead of the "do you want to rebuild out-of-date modules?" prompt you'd normally get.
:::

:::warning
If you are adding plugin binaries into source control, don't forget to also add the `.modules` files that the Unreal build system places in the `Binaries/<Platform>` folder. If you only add the `.dll` files and don't add the `.modules` files, that will cause the "module not found" error message for other members of your team.

## Add a Source directory to your project if you don't already have one

If you don't already have a `Source` directory in your project, you'll need to add one. If you can't load the editor to add the first C++ class due to the module load error, you'll need to manually create this directory and the default files that need to be in it.

In the following files, you should replace `<PROJECTNAME>` in file names and file contents with the name of your project (so that it matches the name of your `.uproject` file):

### Source/&lt;PROJECTNAME&gt;.Target.cs

```csharp
using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class <PROJECTNAME>Target : TargetRules
{
    public <PROJECTNAME>Target(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Game;
        DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.Latest;
        IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Latest;

        ExtraModuleNames.AddRange(new[]
        {
          "<PROJECTNAME>"
        });
    }
}
```

### Source/&lt;PROJECTNAME&gt;Editor.Target.cs

```csharp
using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class <PROJECTNAME>EditorTarget : TargetRules
{
    public <PROJECTNAME>EditorTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Game;
        DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.Latest;
        IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Latest;
    }
}
```

### Source/&lt;PROJECTNAME&gt;/&lt;PROJECTNAME&gt;.Build.cs

```csharp
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class <PROJECTNAME> : ModuleRules
{
    public <PROJECTNAME>(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;

        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[]
        {
            "Core",
        });
    }
}
```

### Source/&lt;PROJECTNAME&gt;/Private/Module.cpp

```csharp
#include "Modules/ModuleManager.h"

IMPLEMENT_PRIMARY_GAME_MODULE(FDefaultGameModuleImpl, <PROJECTNAME>, "<PROJECTNAME>");
```

### &lt;PROJECTNAME&gt;.uproject

Add the `Modules` section to your `.uproject` file, like so:

```json
	"Description": "",
	"Modules": [
		{
			"Name": "<PROJECTNAME>",
			"Type": "Runtime",
			"LoadingPhase": "Default"
		}
	],
```

## Generate project files

Right-click on your `.uproject` file and click "Generate project files..."

## Build and launch your project in Visual Studio

Open the generated `.sln` file, and click the green play button in the toolbar. This will build any out-of-date modules and launch the editor.
