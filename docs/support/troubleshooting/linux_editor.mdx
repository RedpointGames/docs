description: Learn how to launch the editor on Linux.

Epic's EOSShared plugin copies the EOS SDK that ships with the engine into the same location that the Redpoint plugin copies it when targeting Linux. This is because unlike Windows and macOS, Linux does not support delay loading dynamic libraries from different locations, so we can not place the EOS SDK in a location that does not conflict.

In addition, the `bHasProjectBinary=true` configuration value that we set in `DefaultEngine.ini` for you does not impact editor builds. Unlike game or server builds for Linux which will correctly skip copying the EOS SDK from the engine when `bHasProjectBinary=true` is set, editor builds will always attempt to copy the file and result in a conflict.

To launch the editor on Linux, you need to open `Engine/Source/ThirdParty/EOSSDK/EOSSDK.Build.cs` and replace:

```csharp
bool bEnableLink = !(bIsMonolithic && HasProjectBinary);
```

with:

```csharp
bool bEnableLink = false;
```

The editor should then build and launch successfully.

## Modify CollectRuntimeDependencies

If changing `bEnableLink` does not resolve the problem, you can alternatively comment out the following exception from `Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Configuration/UEBuildBinary.cs`:

```csharp
throw new BuildException("Runtime dependency '{0}' is configured to be staged from '{1}' and '{2}'", Dependency.Path, Dependency.SourcePath, ExistingSourceFile);
```

:::danger
Changing `CollectRuntimeDependencies` may result in the incorrect EOS SDK being copied for your project. You must be certain that `EOSShared` is not a runtime dependency of your game, or you may experience issues when running the packaged game. Modify `CollectRuntimeDependencies` only as a last resort.
