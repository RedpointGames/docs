If you're having difficulty code signing or packaging your game on macOS, try the following steps.

## Code sign the dynamic libraries individually

After packaging your game, code sign the `.dylib` files within your package individually by running the following command. Replace the `pkg_path` and `SIGNING_ID` variables as appropriate for your game.

```bash
pkg_path=Path/To/Your.app
SIGNING_ID=SigningIdentity
find "${pkg_path}/Contents" -type f -name "*.dylib" -exec codesign --options runtime --timestamp --entitlements entitlements.plist --force --sign "${SIGNING_ID}" {} \;
```

## Ensure entitlements permit dynamic loading

Ensure that the entitlements for your game permit dynamically loading libraries. A suggested `entitlements.plist` file is as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-executable-page-protection</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```
