title: Missing dependencies for patching UnrealBuildTool
description: The development dependencies you need to install so the plugin can patch UnrealBuildTool to support EOS-enabled games.
---

When you build your project with the plugin enabled, it will try to patch UnrealBuildTool to support EOS-enabled games. UnrealBuildTool is a component of the Unreal Engine build system, and is responsible for building and packaging games for distribution.

Since we need to wrap games in the EOS bootstrapper and Anti-Cheat executables where appropriate, we have to patch UnrealBuildTool to support this.

However, if you've installed the engine through the launcher and are developing blueprint-only projects, you might not have all of the dependencies required for the patching process to work.

:::warning
You must build at least once in Visual Studio. The patching process does not complete successfully if you're building in Rider, so you must build at least once in Visual Studio to allow the patching process to succeed.

## Development dependencies for Unreal Engine 5

You must have the following installed:

- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- .NET cross-platform development workload in the Visual Studio installer (scroll down to the bottom)
- .NET Core 3.1 Runtime (LTS) under "Individual components" in the Visual Studio installer

You may have to restart your computer after installing these components for the changes to take effect.

If you've installed all of these components and still receive the warning, try re-installing Visual Studio. You can encounter this warning if you installed an older version of Visual Studio (such as Visual Studio 2017) after installing Visual Studio 2019.

If you've tried re-installing Visual Studio completely and still have issues, please follow up with support in our Discord.
