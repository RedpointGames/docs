description: How to get access to support and source code.
---

Support is only available to developers who have [purchased EOS Online Framework on Fab](https://www.fab.com/listings/b900b244-0ff6-49e3-8562-5fc630ba9515).

## Verify your purchase to open a support case

Login to the [Redpoint Games License Manager](https://licensing.redpoint.games/) and upload your receipt.

Once we've checked your receipt, you'll be able to create a support case in the `#eos-online-framework` channel under the **Support - Standard Support** category.

:::warning
Please make sure you include full logs with verbosity increased as per the instructions below when opening a support case. If you don't include logs and we have to ask for them, it will increase the time it takes for us to solve your issue.

## Increasing log levels

By default the plugin omits some types of logs due to the amount of logging generated. When we're helping you with a support case, it's important that we have as much information as possible to diagnose the problem you're running into. Before you upload logs, please ensure you add the following to `DefaultEngine.ini` so that we have the maximum amount of information available to help you:

```ini

## Enabling logs in Shipping builds

If you have an issue that only reproduces in a Shipping build, you'll need to enable logs in Shipping builds so that we have enough information to diagnose the issue.

To enable logs in Shipping builds, you must:

- Have at least one C++ file in your Unreal Engine project, so that `YourProject.Target.cs` exists, and
- Have the [plugin cloned from Git](/setup/index.mdx#source-code-access) and installed in the project's Plugins folder.

Locate the `YourProject.Target.cs` file in your project. If you're using a version of the engine installed via the Epic Games Launcher, you also need to add:

```csharp
bUseLoggingInShipping = true;
bOverrideBuildEnvironment = true;
```

Alternatively, if you're using a source version of Unreal Engine (i.e. from GitHub or Perforce), instead add:

```csharp
bUseLoggingInShipping = true;
BuildEnvironment = TargetBuildEnvironment.Unique;
```

Now when you build and run your game in Shipping configuration, logs will be generated to the `Saved/Logs` folder the same as it would for the Development configuration.

### Additional instructions for Android

On Android, you need to modify `AndroidPlatformMisc.cpp` to replace an incorrect logging guard. Locate `FAndroidMisc::LocalPrint` and then replace:

```cpp
#if !UE_BUILD_SHIPPING || ENABLE_PGO_PROFILE
```

with:

```cpp
#if !NO_LOGGING || ENABLE_PGO_PROFILE
```

This requires building the engine from source; if you do not use a source-based engine, logs will not be emitted on Android as `AndroidPlatformMisc.cpp` will not be rebuilt.

## Enabling additional diagnostics

There are a few diagnostic options which must be manually enabled at compile-time if you want to use them. This is because they emit huge amounts of data to the logs, but they can be useful for diagnosing otherwise subtle problems.

In your project's `Build.cs` file:

```csharp
// Emits the full state of all parties and lobbies to the log whenever a lobby operation or event occurs.
// This allows you to see the full state of all lobbies at every moment in time.
ProjectDefinitions.Add("ONLINE_SUBSYSTEM_EOS_ENABLE_STATE_DIAGNOSTICS=1");

// Turns on network tracing, which emits information about every packet sent or received over P2P
// connections through the EOS networking driver. Network packet information is emitted to the
// LogRedpointEOSNetworkTrace category, which is on by default if you've enabled compile-time support with
// this option below.
ProjectDefinitions.Add("ONLINE_SUBSYSTEM_EOS_ENABLE_NETWORK_TRACING=1");
```

## Accessing the source code

You can access the source code on the [Redpoint GitLab](https://src.redpoint.games/redpointgames/). Use the same Redpoint ID to sign in that you use with the License Manager.
