title: Additional search locations for the EOS SDK
description: A list of additional locations that the Redpoint EOS Online Framework plugin will look in to find the EOS SDK.
---

In addition to the [recommended installation location for the EOS SDK](../setup/index.mdx#installing-the-eos-sdk) mentioned in the getting started guide, the plugin will also search the following locations:

- `C:\Users\<username>\Downloads\EOS-SDK-(Version)`
- `C:\ProgramData\EOS-SDK-(Version)`
- `C:\EOS-SDK-(Version)`
- `/Users/<username>/Downloads/EOS-SDK-(Version)`

A full list of search locations can be found in the `Source\RedpointEOSSDK\RedpointEOSSDKInfo.json` file included in the plugin.

:::danger
We don't recommend using the locations above, as it will mean each team member needs to install the EOS SDK locally. You should place the EOS SDK in your project's `Plugins` directory as recommended by the setup guide, and check the EOS SDK into your source control system.
