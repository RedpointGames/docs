- Added support for [proximity voice chat via the Redpoint Voice Chat component](/docs/framework/voice_chat.mdx). This component can manage voice chat channel connections for you on listen servers and dedicated servers, and vastly simplifies voice chat implementations in multiplayer games.
  - If you are currently managing voice chat connections manually on game servers, it is recommended that you use the Redpoint Voice Chat component instead.
- The [Minute of Mayhem example project](/docs/examples/minute/index.mdx) has been updated:
  - Minute of Mayhem now targets Unreal Engine 5.7.
  - Added a new game mode selection, to select between 'Tempo' and 'Proximity'.
  - Added a new 'Proximity' game mode and map, which demonstrates using the new Redpoint Voice Chat component and proximity voice chat.
  - Added a new in-game options menu that allows you to return to the main menu or exit the game.
  - Improved support for controllers, including movement during gameplay and interacting with login prompts during startup.
- Added support for [anonymous access to Title Storage](/docs/ossv1/title_file/anonymous.mdx), allowing game clients to download files from Title Storage before the first user signs in.
- Customizing widget presentation during authentication is now done via the [IRedpointEOSAuthWidgetFactory](/docs/auth/custom_ui.mdx). This allows you to display widgets with Common UI, and makes routing focus easier for games that have controller support.
  - The existing "EOS Subsystem" and the events it provides are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  - We have added a "Redpoint Widget Reference List" data asset type, which makes it easier to ensure your custom authentication widgets are included when your project is cooked.
- Sanction checks now allow players to connect if the EOS SDK returns `EOS_UnexpectedError` during EOS outages.
- Added a "Is Play-in-Editor?" blueprint node, which can be used to detect when the game is running in the editor.
- Improved logging when overriding the game mode in team-based matchmaking.
- Improved the [Voice Chat Debugger](/docs/tools/voice_chat_debugger.mdx), and documented this editor tool.
- Fixed an issue where invites on Meta Quest were processed before the local user was signed in.
- Fixed a periodic lag spike when the plugin refreshed audio devices; refreshing the audio device list is now done on a background thread.
- Fixed a rare deadlock when voice chat channels are being cleaned up.
- Removed support for EOS SDK 1.16.
