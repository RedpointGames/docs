### 2025.09.29

This release removes EOS SDK 1.17.1.3 from the supported version list due to a regression in the EOS SDK that impacts players being able to sign into games:

- EOS SDK 1.17.1.3 will no longer be used by the plugin due to a bug in the EOS SDK. Please download and use EOS SDK 1.17.0 instead.
  - EOS SDK 1.18.0.4 is also impacted by this same bug, and is not included in the EOS SDK supported version list for this reason.
- Added support for setting a custom game mode when the matchmaker starts a listen server.
- Added support for specifying dedicated server client ID, secret and private key on the command-line with editor-based dedicated servers (i.e. using `-server` with the editor binary). We also improved log messages when dedicated servers are missing required configuration on the command line.
- Added new blueprint nodes that can automatically convert between data values (string, 64-bit integers, boolean and double values) and the "Online Session Setting" blueprint type. This makes blueprint graphs that interact with session settings much cleaner.
- Added support for overriding the assigned teams for party members when initially queuing into matchmaking. This allows you to intentionally split the party to different teams.
- Added the "Presence Status Text" property to the "Redpoint Friend List Entry" object, allowing you to display a friend's custom presence text in bound friend lists.
- Added the `IgnoreCommandLineSandboxAndDeployment` configuration option. When turned on, builds launched from the Epic Games store will always use the Live sandbox, even when launched on the Dev or Stage channels.
- Fixed an issue where the cross-platform fallback authentication graph was not selected when testing in the editor.
- Fixed an issue where local platform accounts would not be linked to the product user ID upon the first login when Epic Games is selected as the cross-platform account provider.
- Fixed indentation used when the plugin applies post-staging hooks to the engine.
- Fixed an issue where players would not see the "link Steam to Epic Games" prompt when cross-platform accounts are required.
- Fixed an issue where the Epic Games overlay would not display when launching on the Epic Games Store without Epic Games set as the cross-platform account provider.
- Added Unreal Engine 5.3 back to our build matrix to support a customer with a premium support plan.
