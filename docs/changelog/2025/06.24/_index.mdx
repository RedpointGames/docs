### 2025.06.24

EOS Online Framework is now available and brings team matchmaking and blueprint support into the EOS plugin, along with many more features, improvements and bug fixes.

To upgrade to the EOS Online Framework:

- If you already own the 'EOS Online Subsystem' plugin, you can upgrade to EOS Online Framework through the Fab launcher or GitLab. EOS Online Framework replaces EOS Online Subsystem and is an in-place upgrade.
- If you own another Redpoint plugin, including 'Online Subsystem Blueprints' and 'Matchmaking', and have not previously purchased 'EOS Online Subsystem', you can now [upgrade on Fab and GitLab through the License Manager for free](https://licensing.redpoint.games/upgrade).

The changes in EOS Online Framework 2025.06.24 are as follows:

- [Team matchmaking](/docs/matchmaking/index.md) is now included in EOS Online Framework.
- [Blueprint support](/docs/ossv1/index.mdx) is now included in EOS Online Framework, for both Paid and Free Edition users.
- We've overhauled our documentation to make it easier to find what you're looking for depending on how you're integrating Epic Online Services. [Our documentation is now also on GitHub](https://github.com/RedpointGames/docs) and we accept pull requests for contributions.
- We've released a [brand new example project "Minute of Mayhem"](/docs/examples/minute/index.mdx), which demonstrates how to use EOS parties, team matchmaking, player preferences and synchronising those preferences to other party members, first-person gameplay and more.
- Added support for Unreal Engine 5.6.
- Added support for EOS SDK 41373641-v1.17.0.
- Added a "Get Party Configuration" blueprint node on the online party type.
- Added support for packet handlers to support Oodle network compression.
- Added a new [RedpointGameInstance base class that provides automatic login and startup screens](/docs/framework/automatic_login.mdx).
- Added support for querying Steam DLC without enabling the Steam inventory service.
- Added support for [automatically creating parties](/docs/framework/automatic_parties.mdx) when the player signs in, and ensuring that the player is always in a party even if they leave via the overlay.
- Added support for specifying `-DevAuthToolName=` on the command line for non-Shipping games to use a specific credential in the Developer Authentication Tool for login.
- Added a new [RedpointAvatar](/docs/framework/displaying_avatars.mdx) UMG widget which greatly simplifies displaying player avatars in your game.
- Added a "Set Entry Spacing for List View" blueprint node that can be used to set the list entry spacing for UMG list and tree views without relying on the CommonUI plugin.
- Added support for the `bIsPlayingThisGame` field on [friend presence](/docs/ossv1/presence/querying.mdx).
- Added support for [binding the friend and party list to UMG tree view widgets](/docs/framework/bind_friends_list.mdx), which greatly simplifies adding friend lists to your game.
- Added a "Get Release Version" blueprint node which reads the release version information generated by [the Unreal Engine Tool](https://github.com/RedpointGames/uet).
- Added various gameplay ability system and backpack classes to the plugin. These are primarily intended to support the "Minute of Mayhem" example project and to allow the example project to be used without any C++. They should be considered experimental until documented in the future.
- Added a `RedpointMatchmakerTeamComponent` that can be added to player state classes. This component is intended to replace the current "Get Team and Slot for Player" blueprint nodes, and will be documented in the future.
- Added support for "Sign in with Apple" without relying on engine code. The engine no longer needs to be built from source in order to sign in with Apple on iOS.
- Added low-level memory tracker tags to the plugin to allow for more granular memory profiling.
- Added a "Are All Expected Players Connected from Matchmaker?" blueprint node, which returns true when all players have connected to the game server and the match can start.
- Added support for [pre-caching files from Player Data Storage during login](/docs/ossv1/user_cloud/precache.mdx).
- Added blueprint conversion nodes to make converting to and from `FVariantDataBP` much simpler.
- Updated the default values of `FOnlinePartyConfiguration` to more closely match what most games will need to use.
- The "login before play-in-editor" setting is now remembered across editor restarts. If the setting was previously turned on, the editor will start the Developer Authentication Tool on launch if it isn't already running.
- Improved login behaviour on Meta Quest and itch.io when Epic Games accounts are enabled.
- Fixed an issue where the Developer Authentication Tool did not start if the path was too long.
- Fixed an issue where outages with the EOS sanctions service would prevent players from connecting to any multiplayer servers. Sanctions checks now "fail open"; if the sanctions service can not be reached by the server, players will be allowed to connect regardless.
- Fixed an issue that prevented users from signing in with itch.io.
- Fixed an issue where CreateSession would not work on dedicated servers if the dedicated server user ID wasn't passed in as the hosting user ID. On dedicated servers, CreateSession now defaults to the dedicated server user ID if no user ID is provided.
- Fixed an issue where cross-platform friends would not load if a runtime platform provided at least one blocked user.
- Fixed an issue where authentication with the Meta SDK would be attempted on machines with the Meta Quest Link App installed, even if the game has no Meta app ID configured.
- Fixed an issue where setting the license key in the Free Edition would not apply until the editor was restarted.
- Fixed an issue where the "Party Member Changed" event on the [RedpointPartyMember actor](/docs/framework/party_members.mdx) would not fire in response to a player being promoted to party leader.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when network connections were closed.
- Fixed support for the `LinuxArm64` platform.
- Fixed an issue where unified friends would not source presence information from the local platform if it was available.
- Fixed an issue where the Epic Games integration would incorrectly fire the presence change event internally when only the local player's presence status was changing.
- Fixed an issue where a player blocked on the local platform could still be displayed as a cross-platform friend.
- Fixed an issue where the Developer Authentication Tool could not be used for authentication in non-Shipping packaged games for testing scenarios.
- Fixed an issue where games with Easy Anti-Cheat enabled could take a long time to complete network connections, due to game content being verified by EAC. You must now enable 'Pak Signing' in Project Settings if you enable Easy Anti-Cheat, which allows Unreal Engine to perform much faster verification of content than EAC can.
- Fixed an issue where persistent Epic Games credentials were not cleared when the user signs out and the game is using the "Cross-Platform Only" authentication graph.
- Fixed an issue where the Epic Games overlay would not appear if the game was launched on the Epic Games Store but did not have cross-platform accounts enabled on other platforms.
- Fixed an issue where friends deleted on the local platform were not deleted from the cross-platform friends cached stored in Player Data Storage.
- Fixed a crash on shutdown if the game instance was no longer valid when the online subsystems were being destroyed.
- Fixed a crash if a room transaction finishes after play-in-editor stops.
- Fixed a memory leak in API calls that use the `ObjectSyncCopy` pattern.
- Fixed an issue where identity hook logs were not emitted in Shipping builds with "enable logs in Shipping" turned on.
- Fixed an issue where matchmaking would not automatically destroy the existing game session before attempting to create a new one when starting a listen server, resulting in matchmaking failures.
- Fixed an issue where a stale friend cache would be used if a user no longer had any friends.
- Fixed support for calling the receipt-less version of `Checkout` on the purchase interface when using Epic Games e-commerce.
- Fixed an issue where party attribute values were not visible to blueprints on the `RedpointPartyMember` events.
- Fixed an issue where the [gameplay debugger for P2P networking](/docs/tools/gameplay_debugger.mdx) did not show NAT status.
- Fixed an issue where `ShowInviteUI` on the external UI interface would fail with "This platform does not have a native subsystem", even though external UI functionality is now provided internally in the plugin.
- Fixed an issue where Meta Quest invites could be consumed prior to the user being signed in.
- Searches for lobbies and parties are now automatically retried with exponential backoff if the EOS SDK returns `EOS_TooManyRequests` or `EOS_TimedOut`.
- Replaced integration with the Discord Game SDK with the Discord Social SDK. If you have enabled Discord support in your game, you will need to download the [new Discord Social SDK](https://discord.com/developers/social-sdk).
- Renamed several framework classes for more consistent naming. The plugin automatically sets the necessary class redirects.
- Dedicated servers will now exit if they are unable to initialise the EOS SDK, instead of continuing to run with the NULL subsystem.
- Removed support for Unreal Engine 5.2.
- Removed the call to `UpdatePresenceInterest` inside `GetAdvertisedParty`. The `GetAdvertisedParty` call on the online subsystem APIs can now only be used to query the party advertised by friends, unless you explicitly subscribe to presence information of other users via the [presence system C++ APIs](/docs/systems/presence.md).
