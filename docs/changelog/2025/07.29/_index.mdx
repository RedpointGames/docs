- The ["Minute of Mayhem" example project](/docs/examples/minute/index.mdx) now demonstrates how to implement "Add Friend by Friend Code" flow with cross-platform friends.
- Fixed an issue where several functions for the friend list widget binding did not correctly indicate whether the action was appropriate for the friend list entry.
- Fixed an issue where console clients could not join an Anti-Cheat protected dedicated server.
- Fixed an issue where the Paid Edition download from the License Manager would not rebuild under Visual Studio if the build environment or SDK was different than the pre-built binaries.
- Fixed an issue where post-staging hooks did not locate the EOS SDK correctly if it was placed in the project's Plugins folder.
