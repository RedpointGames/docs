## Enter your license key (Free Edition only)

If you are using the Free Edition, you will be provided with a license key from the [Redpoint Games License Manager](https://licensing.redpoint.games). When you've installed the plugin in your project, you'll need to set the license key. You can do that either by setting the license key in the `DefaultEngine.ini` file, or by changing it through "Project Settings".

This does not apply to Paid Edition users.

```ini
